git rev-list --count HEAD

git log .gitignore

d)Branches can be used when fixing bugs in order to manipulate the files without 
compromising the master branch. It also is used for the same reason when 
implementing a new functionality.

e)Git status prints the working tree status. Git log prints the commits instead of the tree.

f)git log Weapon.h

g)git log --grep="file"

h)Inheritance is when a class receives parts of it's definition from another class.
In other words a class is a child from other class.

Polymorphism can be when there's overloaded functions in a class that have the same
name but different parameters. Or when a children class modifies or changes 
completely a function of the parent class.

Encapsulation is when the private variables of a class are wraped under setter and
getter functions.

i)In the intregration workflow each developer gets two repositories and each of them push to 
their public rep.. In the Dictator workflow there's only one rep. per developer 
and they push to the next hierarchy.

j)In the case that all of the developers where to commit changes on the same files
a centralized workflow would require an enourmous amount of extra work. The dictator
workflow would divide and conquer such issue making it way faster and efficient.

5.

A)Polymorphism is indeed used in this prototype. It uses it when the children classes
of the class Weapon modify their hit function. The keyword virtual makes it a requirement 
for each child of Weapon.
B)Encapsulation is also used in the protoype. Specifically the weapon classes are
being encapsulated by the class WeaponFactory which is the one that returns everything 
from those classes in main.
